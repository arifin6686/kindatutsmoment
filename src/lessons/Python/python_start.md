# Python Getting Started

## 1. Python Install

Many PCs and Macs will have python already installed.
To check if you have python installed on a Windows PC, search in the start bar for Python or run the following on the Command Line (cmd.exe):

```bash
python --version
```

If you find that you do not have Python installed on your computer, then you can download it for free from the following website: [Python](https://www.python.org/)

## 2. Python Quickstart

Python is an interpreted programming language, this means that as a developer you write Python (.py) files in a text editor and then put those files into the python interpreter to be executed.

The way to run a python file is like this on the command line:

```bash
python helloworld.py
```

Where "helloworld.py" is the name of your python file.

Let's write our first Python file, called helloworld.py, which can be done in any text editor.

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

Simple as that. Save your file. Open your command line, navigate to the directory where you saved your file, and run:

```bash
python helloworld.py
```
The output should read:

```bash
Hello, World!
```

Congratulations, you have written and executed your first Python program.
